# SQL_course

This repo contains my code for the [Database Management Essentials](https://www.coursera.org/learn/database-management?specialization=data-warehousing) online course from University of Colorado.

I configured my home desktop computer into a MySQL server accessible from the public Internet (took some steps to ensure security), which was fun and gave me some more hands-on experience with computer networking :D

Things I learnt include:
* various relational DBMS vendors
* how to read ERDs (entity relationship diagrams)
* creating and inserting into tables
* updating and deleting entries
* querying data (JOINs, aggregate functions) and query formulation guidelines
* how to use TRIGGERs as a workaround to MYSQL infamously not supporting CHECK constraints (and not throwing any warnings or errors too...)
